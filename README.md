# BanglAssist

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exponential improvements that promise transformative opportunities across various industries. Their ability to generate human-like text and ensure continuous availability facilitates the creation of interactive service chatbots aimed at enhancing customer experience and streamlining enterprise operations. Despite their potential, LLMs face critical challenges such as susceptibility to hallucinations and difficulties handling complex linguistic scenarios, notably code-switching and dialectal variations. To address these challenges, BanglAssist was designed as a multilingual chatbot for Bengali-English customer service interactions in collaboration with Bengali OTT Hoichoi utilizing an effective translation step, retrieval augmented generation, and targeted prompt engineering. This work offers valuable insights for the design of multilingual customer service agents that accommodate linguistic diversity to benefit both customers and businesses. By addressing the intersection of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and cultural heterogeneity, it inspires future innovations in multilingual and multicultural human-computer interaction.
